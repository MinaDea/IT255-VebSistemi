			<p> Benjamin Geza Affleck-Boldt (born August 15, 1972), better known as Ben Affleck, is an American actor and filmmaker. He began his career as a child actor, starring in the PBS educational series The Voyage of the Mimi (1984, 1988). He later appeared in Dazed and Confused and various Kevin Smith films including Chasing Amy  and Dogma. Affleck gained fame when he and childhood friend Matt Damon won the Golden Globe and the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for Good Will Hunting . He then starred in high-profile films including Armageddon, Shakespeare in Love , Pearl Harbor (2001), Changing Lanes and The Sum of All Fears. After a career downturn, during which he appeared in Daredevil and the much-derided Gigli , Affleck received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in Hollywoodland.
			Affleck's directorial debut, Gone Baby Gone, which he also wrote, was well received. He then directed, co-wrote, and starred in The Town , which was named among the National Board of Review: Top Ten Films of the year. For the political thriller Argo (2012), which he directed and starred in, Affleck won the Golden Globe Award and BAFTA Award for Best Director.</p>
